# SuperMDS

Parallelized implementation of MultiDimensional Scaling algorithms with support for 
weights, landmarks, stress sampling for performance and Out of Sample Extension (OSE).
Provides an approximation inverse transform to go from lower dimensional space up to high dimensional using a Multilateration method. (works but needs work)
placeholder JavaFX gui (wip) to test functions against synthetic data.
